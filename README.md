## Jira version release

This project was built to help developers, product owners, managers and anyone else in the process of creating and distributing release notes across multiple communication channels. By integrating with Jira release notes, the bot will automatically generate release notes from the information that is in your issues and jira versions, saving you time and effort.

### How It Works
This integration works by pulling information from your Jira tickets and using it to generate release notes.

When a version is released, you can choose a channel in slack or discord to publish release notes for your newest project versionðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠ. All automated, just post the version and the messages with the related tasks and description are posted

```txt
The format of the message is the same as when you copy from jira, but with an added version description at the top
```
